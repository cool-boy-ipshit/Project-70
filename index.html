                    What is STEM?
                    There is a lot of buzz around STEM education these days in advanced countries like the United States and across some of the leading schools even in India. What exactly is STEM education?
                    <br>
                    STEM education is all about the teaching of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math as interconnected disciplines. It is an integrated approach to help students connect Math and Science learning to real world applications, ensuring they stay engaged. Technology and digital tools are an integral part of our 21st century world. Preparing our students to leverage them for learning with technological tools is key to success. The hands-on projects of STEM learning teaches children how to design and engineer, as a structured process, and create innovative solutions to problems.
                    <br>
                    STEM education has been proved to be an effective way to help students acquire skills like creativity, critical thinking, collaboration and communication skills. It does so in a way that makes learning Science and Math fun, integrating technological tools like tablets and internet usage. There is substantial evidence to show that students' academic scores improve but also students gain deeper understanding of the subject, alongside life and leadership skills.
